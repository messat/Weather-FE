# Weather Channel

This is my front-end solo project completed using React with Vite and tailwind-CSS to create a weather channel. This displays the current weather for both the current location and the destination searched. It also gives you the 3-hour and daily forecast. The background indicates the overall temprature of the location.


The fully deployed app is available at https://global-weather-channel.netlify.app/.

To retrieve live data about the weather and weather icons, I used a free weather API https://openweathermap.org/api. 

The app has functionality such as converting temperature from celcius to farenheit. 
Also when searching for different destinations, information about the current date and time is shown. 
I used toastify package to give user feedback when fetching new data. 


Moving forward I aim to improve the styling of my app and add additional accessibility features in an effort to create a better user experience.
